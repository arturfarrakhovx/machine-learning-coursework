# Assignment 4 â€“ Neural Networks & Multiclass Classification (ML2)

## ðŸ“˜ Task
Solve a **multiclass classification problem** on image data (Fashion MNIST).  
The dataset contained grayscale images of size **32Ã—32 pixels**, provided in CSV format.  
The task required designing and training both **feedforward** and **convolutional** neural network models.

## ðŸ”¬ Approach
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Normalized pixel values to [0,1]  
  - Split data into train/validation/test subsets  
  - Created PyTorch `TensorDataset` and `DataLoader`  

- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN):**  
  - Tested multiple depths and layer sizes  
  - Experimented with activation functions and optimizers
  - Validation accuracy: ~84%  

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):**  
  - Tried different architectures (2â€“5 convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, batch normalization)  
  - Validation accuracy: **~90%**, outperforming FNN  

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Final model: **CNN with 5 convolutional layers + max pooling + batch normalization + 1 fully connected layer**  
- Test accuracy: **0.91**  
- Evaluation accuracy: **0.90** (confirmed in feedback, considered a good result)
