# Assignment 1 â€“ Data Preprocessing & Binary Classification (ML1)

## ðŸ“˜ Task
Perform data preprocessing and solve a **binary classification** problem using the Titanic dataset.  
The goal is to prepare features of mixed types for machine learning, apply models, and evaluate performance.  

## ðŸ”¬ Approach
- **Preprocessing:** handling missing values, feature encoding, normalization, feature selection.  
- **Models:** Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors.  
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC.  

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Best model: **k-NN**  
- Test accuracy: ~0.75  
- AUC: 0.82
- Evaluation set accuracy: **0.8317**
