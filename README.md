# Machine Learning Coursework

## üìò Overview
This repository contains coursework assignments completed as part of the Machine Learning course.  
Each assignment is organized in a separate directory with its corresponding Jupyter notebook, datasets (if available), and prediction results.  

## üìÇ Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `01_data-preprocessing-binary-classification/` ‚Äì Binary classification with data preprocessing  
- `02_regression-life-expectancy/` ‚Äì Regression problem predicting life expectancy  
- `03_dimensionality-reduction-binary-classification/` ‚Äì Dimensionality reduction and binary classification  
- `04_neural-networks-multiclass-classification/` ‚Äì Feedforward and convolutional neural networks for multiclass classification  

Each directory contains:
- Jupyter notebook with the full solution  
- Training and evaluation datasets (if available)  
- `results.csv` with predictions for the evaluation set
